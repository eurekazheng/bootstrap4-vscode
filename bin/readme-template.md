## Contribution guidelines

1. Clone this repo
2. To modify bootstrap snippets, you can find the templates for each snippet under `src/util/resources/bootstrap`. These Html snippets must follow [sublime text snippet](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/snippets.html) format. There is no need to update `snippets.json` manually. The build will take care of regenerating this file from template files.
3. If you need to change `README.md` (or) `package.json`, you should modify their templates (which are used to generate the root level files) under `src/util/resources`. For eg., If you want `package.json` at the root to be modified, you should change `package-template.json` under `src/util/resources`. These root level `package.json` & `README.md` are regenerated for every build from their corresponding templates.
4. To modify font awesome snippets, you would need to modify `font-awesome.json` under `src/util/resources`
